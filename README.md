# ğŸ“±Flutter UI with Riverpod

This is a dedicated **learning project** built with Flutter, focused on mastering **UI layouts**, **state management using Riverpod**, and exploring a wide array of commonly used widgets. It serves as a personal sandbox for hands-on practice and understanding widget behavior under various conditions.

---

## âœ¨ Overview

Explore and practice common Flutter UI layouts, widgets, and state management techniques. This project serves as a sandbox to experiment with different widgets and their behavior under various conditions, enabling a deeper understanding of Flutter's rendering pipeline.

## ğŸš€ Features

-   **UI Components Practice**: Hands-on experience with core layout widgets (`Row`, `Column`, `Container`, `Stack`, `SizedBox`, `Expanded`), focusing on properties like `mainAxisAlignment` and `crossAxisAlignment`.
-   **State Management**: Integration with **Riverpod** for robust and scalable state management.
-   **Widget Sandbox**: A dedicated page for experimenting and testing various Flutter Widgets, including `TextField` with `InputDecoration` customizations, diverse `ElevatedButton` styles, and intricate `ListTile` configurations.
-   **Interactive Elements**: Implementation of `AlertDialog`, `Switch`, `Checkbox`, and `IconButton` with UI feedback using `SnackBar`.
-   **Progress Indicators**: Usage of `CircularProgressIndicator` and `LinearProgressIndicator` to visualize loading states.
-   **Image Handling**: Displaying network images with `Image.network` and handling potential loading errors.
-   **Advanced Layouts**: Exploration of `Transform` properties on `Container` within `Row` for complex visual effects.
-   **Styling**: In-depth customization of `TextStyle`, `ShapeBorder`, `BoxDecoration`, and various other styling properties.
-   **Modular Structure**: Well-structured and organized codebase for clarity and maintainability.
